# Lab

In today's lab, we will be examining the use of enum classes in the context of [formatting output in the terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code).

Specifically, you will write a C++ program that implements an enum class for the [SGR codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#SGR_(Select_Graphic_Rendition)_parameters).

Your enum class should represent *at least* the codes for `normal`, `bold`, and foreground colors 30-37. Additional experimentation is encouraged.

You should create a main function that prints examples normal, bold, and colored text using these codes.

You may see [my aurora code in Bash](https://github.com/dowobeha/aurora/blob/main/aurora.sh) for an example of using these codes.
