*Write a two or three sentence summary, followed by bullet points.*


### Class summary
  Last semester was awesome, I learned a lot. I already know a little of C++ and using bash terminal, so some material was easier for me to grasp. The assignments were fun. There was an appropriate amount of reading, and homework. The class was fun, we listened to that music video and talked about CS and programming application in the real world. Overall, a good experience.

### Strengths and Weaknesses 
<ul>
  <li>I/O Functionality such as cin and cout</li>
  <li>Classes, class constructors, and creating seperate files like header files to simplify functionality per program</li>
  <li>I think I got much better at paying attention to syntax errors, and catching them before compiling</li>
  <li>This was my first time using GIT, so I think that was a huge +</li>
</ul>
