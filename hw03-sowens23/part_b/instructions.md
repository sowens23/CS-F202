# HW03 - Part B (13%)

Part B of [this assignment](../README.md) provides you with an opportunity to demonstrate a satisfactory understanding of the contents from [Chapters 17 and 18 of Programming Principles and Practice using C++][textbook].


### What you should do

In this subdirectory:

* Copy your code from `part_c`

* Add the following methods to the `LinkedList` class:
  - `int size() const` that returns the number of elements in the list
  - `bool contains(double element) const` that returns `true` if `element` is a value in the list

* A main function in `part_b.cpp` that
  - Constructs a LinkedList object
  - Adds the numbers to the list
  - Tests the `size()` and `contains()` methods
  
* A makefile with all appropriate targets

* Remove the `cerr` debug statements from your constructors and destructors
