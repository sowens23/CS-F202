Hi Spencer,

Notes are graded as five levels: Excellent (95-100), Good (85-94), Average (70-84),
Fair (60-69), Poor (under 60).
Your grading for the notes (week 12, 4/7) is Good(85) (because I didn't really recognize in your notes which part is week 12...).
If you have any questions, feel free to ask Dr. Schwartz or Yali.
